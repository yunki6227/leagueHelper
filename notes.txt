league api only offers 20 games for each account.
However, I could try to scrape data straight from op.gg
^ worked, see test.py

blue side is top and red side is bottom, need to figure out which team is "our" team.
^ possibly name being yellow. BGR value = 51,182,232
^^^^ Done

I need these things to connect skin name to actual champion:
1. need to get a list of skins(maybe i need to request it from a website)
2. need to connect those list of skins to a champion (maybe dictionary?)
3. Then just do dictionary[skinName], which will return a champion name. Edit: will just use sqlite database
^^^^ Done

when string from image is in the list of skin_name of database, then get its corresponding champion_name and replace. If not, then it'll mean that it is just a regular champion name, so just keep the same.
^^^^  Done

After all champion names, including skin name, have been converted to regular champion name, then link up with op.gg to do features.
^^^^ Done

Need to do: 
keep watching the background then when loading screen pops up, it automatically runs.
also need to put more useful statistics out. ALso need some form of GUI to output it cleanly


learned:
1. names for classes and stuff of inspect element in website might not match what soup gets, so if it doesn't work, print soup and look for it.
