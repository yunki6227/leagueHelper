league api only offers 20 games for each account.
However, I could try to scrape data straight from op.gg
^ worked, see test.py

blue side is top and red side is bottom, need to figure out which team is "our" team.
^ possibly name being yellow

I need these things to connect skin name to actual champion:
1. need to get a list of skins(maybe i need to request it from a website)
2. need to connect those list of skins to a champion (maybe dictionary?)
3. Then just do dictionary[skinName], which will return a champion name. Edit: will just use sqlite database

future feature: keep watching the background then when loading screen pops up, it automatically runs.

when string from image is in the list of skin_name of database, then get its corresponding champion_name and replace. If not, then it'll mean that it is just a regular champion name, so just keep the same.

After all champion names, including skin name, have been converted to regular champion name, then link up with op.gg to do features.


Need to do: detect if player is red team or blue team and change order. If player is in top team, then the player is in the blue team.
If the player is on the bottom, then the player is in the red team.
Thus, change the order of name 1 to 5 with 6 to 10 if the player is
on the bottom. This can be done by detecting yellow font perhaps.


learned:
1. names for classes and stuff of inspect element in website might not match what soup gets, so if it doesn't work, print soup and look for it.
